$# represents the number of positional parameters (arguments) passed to the script. This is useful for validating input and controlling script execution based on the number of arguments provided.

#!/bin/bash

echo "Number of arguments: $#"

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "No arguments provided."
else
  echo "Arguments provided: $@"
fi

$#: Gives the count of arguments passed to the script. If you run the script with ./example.sh arg1 arg2, $# will be 2.

$@: Represents all the arguments passed to the script, preserving each argument as a separate entity. For example, arg1 and arg2 would be treated as separate arguments.
