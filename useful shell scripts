 Automates the deployment of applications. It might involve steps like pulling the latest code from a version control system, building the application, and deploying it to a target environment.

#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting deployment..."
git pull origin main
npm install
npm run build
scp -r ./build user@server:/var/www/html/
echo "Deployment completed."



Creates backups of important data such as databases or configuration files and stores them securely.

#!/bin/bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%F")
BACKUP_DIR="/backups/$TIMESTAMP"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/db_backup.tar.gz" /path/to/database
echo "Backup completed and saved to $BACKUP_DIR"


Monitors system metrics and application health, and sends alerts if something goes

#!/bin/bash
CPU_USAGE=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | sed "s/.*, *\([0-9.]*\)%* id.*/\1/" | awk '{print 100 - $1}')
DISK_USAGE=$(df / | grep / | awk '{ print $5 }' | sed 's/%//g')

if [ $(echo "$CPU_USAGE > 80" | bc) -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "High CPU Usage: $CPU_USAGE%"
fi

if [ $DISK_USAGE -gt 90 ]; then
    echo "High Disk Usage: $DISK_USAGE%"
fi
